    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Birria tacos are so delicious and this recipe is my take on the world's most trendy taco. Seriously, when you make these, you'll understand what all the fuss is about. Start with a batch of my beef birria and use some of the sauce in these shredded beef tacos with cheese. A super savory, aromatic consommé is served on the side for dipping.</p>
    <h2> How to Make Taquito Casserole </h2>
    <p>To make the consommé: Stir beef birria sauce, chicken broth, carrots, celery, and cabbage together in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, occasionally brushing the caramelized bits (fond) off the side with the hot liquid, until vegetables are nice and tender and consommé has reached the desired consistency, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and keep hot while you prepare the tacos.  </p>
